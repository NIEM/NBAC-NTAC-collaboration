A Github repo for collaboration between the NIEM Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC) and the NIEM Business Architecture Committee (NBAC).

- Issue tracker: <https://github.com/NIEM/NBAC-NTAC-collaboration/issues>
- Issue project board: <https://github.com/NIEM/NBAC-NTAC-collaboration/projects/1>

# Workflow

The goal of the NBAC-NTAC collaboration workflow is to support completion of the joint work of the NIEM governance committees with clear responsibility throughout the process. 

Either the NBAC or NTAC may make a request of the other body. Each new request is represented by a new issue in the issue tracker. If a request is part of an existing overarching task, it may be added as a task item in existing issue, or as its own issue, as appropriate. Sub-tasks may be broken out as their own tasks or merged into overarching tasks, as appropriate.

The project board has 3 columns, corresponding to states of an issue:
- NBAC responsibility: The NBAC or its members must do something to resolve an issue.
- NTAC responsibility: The NTAC or its members must do something to resolve an issue.
- Resolved: The tasks for an issue were completed, and need to be validated by the submitter.

# Issue conventions

Assign the issue to a Github user according to which organization is responsible for the issue:
- NTAC responsibility: assign to Github user [TomCarlson-NTAC](https://github.com/TomCarlson-NTAC)
- NBAC responsibility: assign to Github user [cdmgtri](https://github.com/cdmgtri)
- Expect the title and first comment of each issue to be edited as the issue is worked. Place anything that needs to be preserved (like text from a help request) in its own comment, after the first comment.
